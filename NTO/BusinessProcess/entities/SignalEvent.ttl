	dcterms:description """Signals are similar to messages, which is why you can model them in BPMN as events just as you can with messages. 
The symbol for a signal is a triangle. The essential difference between a signal and a message is that that latter 
is always addressed to a specific recipient. (An e-mail contains the e-mail address of the recipient, a call starts 
with dialing the telephone number, and so on.) In contrast, a signal is more like a newspaper advertisement or a television 
commercial. It is relatively undirected. Anyone who receives the signal and wants to react may do so.""";
